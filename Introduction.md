# Description of the problem:

  Company & Co. is a virtual international real estate company focused in renting coworking spaces, based in Central Europe. The company is extending its business to Southern Europe, choosing <b>Madrid</b>, capital of Spain and 4th most relevant city in Europe for a new coworking space. This decission has been made due to the good communications of the city and national and international relevance to make business.

However, the company is facing problems since it is not familiar with the city nor the country, so they are requiring an analysis from data science experts in order to process several relevant data about the city. The main issue is to choose the Madrid cityâ€™s district or neighbourhood most suitable for the expansion of Company & Co to install the new coworking space.

The business development managers have transmitted to the data science team some clear ideas about the basic requirements of the new placement:

- Close to <b>public transport</b>, specially <b>Metro stations</b> (Subway), to ease the access to the users of the coworking spaces.
- Close to <b>offices and business centers</b>, to network with other businesses.
- Close to <b>hotels</b>, making easier to receive international clients.
- Close to <b>restaurants</b> of any kind.

It is also important for Company & Co. to have a comparison of the <b>land value</b> in each district, to make the final decission.
