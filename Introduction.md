# Introduction:

**Company & Co.** is a virtual international real estate company focused in renting offices and coworking spaces, based in Central Europe. The company is extending its business to Southern Europe, choosing **Madrid** for the expansion, since the company have some partner companies already there. Madrid, capital of Spain and the 4th most populated city in Europe, also has the advantages of very good communications to the city and regional and international relevance to make business in Southern Europe.

However, the company is facing problems since it is not familiar with the city area to acquire land for new offices, so they are requiring an analysis from data science experts in order to process all the relevant data about the city. **The main objective is to choose the Madrid cityâ€™s neighbourhood most suitable for the expansion of Company & Co to buy land for a new office, with issues not related with price.**

**The business managers of Company & Co, our target audience and main stakeholder,** transmitted to the data science team some clear ideas about the **basic requirements** of the new placement:

* Accesibility to **public transport**, specially **Metro stations** (Subway), to ease the access to the users of the new offices and/or coworking spaces.
* **Hotels** nearby, making easier to receive international clients.
* **Restaurants** of any kind, so the personnel does not need to take long breaks for meals.

It will be needed to focus on the venues for each neighborhood first, focusing later on the capabilities of each neighborhood to comply the basic requirements for the new place.
