Description of the problem:

Company & Co. is a virtual international real estate company focused in renting coworking spaces, based in Central Europe. The company is extending its business to Madrid, capital of Spain, due to the good communications of the city and national and international relevance to make business.

However, the company is facing problems since it is not familiar with the city or the country, so they are requiring an analysis of data science experts to analyse several relevant data about the city, to choose the Madridâ€™s district or neighbourhood most suitable for the expansion of Company & Co.

The business development managers have transmitted to the data science team some clear ideas about the basic requirements of the new placement:

- Close to public transport, specially Metro stations (Subway), to ease the access to the users of the coworking spaces.
- Close to offices and business centers, to network with other businesses.
- Close to hotels, making easier to receive international clients.
- Close to restaurants of any kind.

It is also important for Company & Co. to have a comparison of the land value in each district, to make the final decission.
